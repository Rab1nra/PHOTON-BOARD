This project is an effort to make a low power microcontroller circuit which is capable of sending data to a remote server , Google in this case , keeping all the power consumption to the lowest, and even have the functionality of showing data using an always on LCD screen. The circuit diagram has been shared , only a single , inexpensive  ESP 12F module has been used , along with a solar to power the circuit , although there are several esp boards out there , but this board has a lot of optimisation in power management , the pcb is single sided making it easier to replicate and code open sourced.

DEPENDENCIES :Before uploading the code you would need to install certain libraries listed below:

This is the adafruit library for Nokia 5110 display module

https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/DHTesp 
This library is used since the conventional library poses some problem with esp boards , this works well

Using to fetch time for updating the display

Also do remember to install the esp core for arduino before proceeding , its pretty simple iâ€™d leave a link to a tutorial
