This project is an effort to make a low power microcontroller circuit which is capable of sending data to a remote server , Google in this case , keeping all the power consumption to the lowest, and even have the functionality of showing data using an always on LCD screen. The circuit diagram has been shared , only a single , inexpensive  ESP 12F module has been used , along with a solar to power the circuit , although there are several esp boards out there , but this board has a lot of optimisation in power management , the pcb is single sided making it easier to replicate and code open sourced.
